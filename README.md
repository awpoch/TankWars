# TankWars

<p>
 Tank Wars is a multiplayer online game. It also includes AI players if you dont have anyone else to play against.
 To try the game out download the reposotory and run server.exe to start the server, AiClient.exe to add AI players
 to the game, and View.exe to start playing the game. You can enter your name and an ip address to connect to (use 
 'localhost' if the server is running on your machine). Then use 'W' 'A' 'S' and 'D' to move around and the mouse 
 to aim your weapon. Left click fires a standard bullet and if you get a power-up (green and yellow circle) you 
 use the right mouse button to fire a lazer beam which kills oponnents instantly.
